Derivative Calculator Project

Compute symbolic derivatives of mathematical expressions automatically in Java.

This engine parses and represents mathematical expressions using a recursive abstract syntax tree (AST), then applies chain, product, and power rules automatically to compute derivatives. It’s designed to be extendable, testable, and human-readable, making it ideal as a CS/math portfolio project.

Features

Handles constants, variables, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers

Automatically applies chain, product, and power rules

Supports basic unary functions: sin, cos (extendable to log, sqrt, etc.)

Outputs symbolic derivatives in human-readable expressions

Clean polymorphic design using abstract base classes for expressions

Easily extendable for future features like step-by-step derivations or string parsing
